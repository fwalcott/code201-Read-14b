# Read 14 B: What Google Learned From its Quest to Build the Perfect Team 


Working collaboratively has increased fifty percent over the last twenty years in the work place. Project  Aristotle was a study of hundreds of teams all working for Google to figure out what mad a team successful. *They looked at different types of work place optimization and other factors. *

## They looked into factors such as:  
~~~
1. Gender Balances   
2. Being Friends Outside Work
3. Being Complete Strangers 
4. Personality Types 
5. Interpersonal and Technical Skills
6. Age 
7. Cultural Background 
8. Being Hierarchical Verses Being Informal  
~~~

It was very difficult for Google *(the best pattern finders on planet Earth)* to find a pattern. Project Aristotle then looked into group norms. The unwritten rules that are a part of team culture. They looked into whether or not people waited their turn or did they speak on top of each other. Did the team have a leader or leaders who did most of the talking or was it more democratic.  

### Project Aristotle Came Up With Three Conclusions:  

1.Teams that finish one assignment usually finish others and those who don't finish one assignment will not finish others. 

2.Teams whose members spoke about equally usually did very well and *if only one person or a small group did the talking the* *** “collective intelligence declined”.*** 

3.Team with people with ***“average social activities”*** or who can read other people emotions based on body language, facial expressions and tone of voice do better. Google then concluded that  an informal team with people sensitive and emphatic to others do the best work. 

***So remember that optimization isn't everything and Google just proved it.***
